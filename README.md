## Credits

I used heavily referenced the mini project for this module, as well as Kevin's and Greg's repositories. Thank you for sharing! I struggled to get started on this project/understand mongoose, so looking at my classmates code helped me to get started, I looked up things I didn't understand and tried to add comments explaining the code where I didn't already know what the code did. Here are the links to the resources I used.
